This is an experimental display typeface I designed and developed based on a strict modular system. The entire character set was constructed from a small, predefined kit of composite parts, challenging the traditional approach to drawing letterforms.

### Design Process

I began by designing a core set of "atomic" units â€” simple lines, curves, and joints. Every letter in the alphabet is a unique combination of these fundamental parts, assembled on a strict grid. The result is a typeface with a distinct, cohesive aesthetic, where the underlying system is visible in the final forms.
