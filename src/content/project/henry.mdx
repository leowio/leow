Henry.social is an app that gives you cashback on your online shopping and includes a smart AI assistant to help you find what you need. The platform became very popular, growing to a community of over 70,000 registered users.

### What I Did

My role on this project was to own the user experience from concept to code. I was responsible for not only how the app looked and felt, but also for building the front-end applications that users interacted with every day.

I was in charge of the visual design and engineering for the website. I designed how everything looked and felt for users (except for the logo and fonts) and then wrote the code to make it work using Next.js, turning my own designs into a fast, responsive website.

On the mobile app, I collaborated with the team on the core UI/UX design. I then led the engineering effort, building out most of the application's features with React Native to ensure a smooth, native-feeling experience on both iOS and Android.

### Technical Architecture

The project was built on a modern, scalable stack. We utilized a Turborepo-based monorepo to manage shared logic, components, and types, which significantly streamlined development between the Next.js and React Native apps. My work involved deep integration with our backend, built on Supabase and Node.js serverless functions, and connecting the UI to the AI features powered by LangChain.
