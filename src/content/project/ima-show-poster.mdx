I designed this poster for a contest held by the Interactive Media Arts (IMA) department at NYU Shanghai. My goal was to create a visual that doesn't use fancy visual effects, but rather uses simple, elegant design to tell the department's story and highlight the event. The design was ultimately awarded second place in the contest.
