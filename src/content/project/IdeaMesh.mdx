Idea Mesh is an "anti-algorithm" Q&A platform I conceived, designed, and built from scratch in just three days for the AdventureX 2025 Hackathon \(it's the biggest hackathon in China, hosted in Hangzhou, China\). I was responsible for Designing and Engineering, from initial idea to a deployed full-stack application.

### The Problem with Predictable Answers

I was tired of seeing the same generic, engagement-driven answers dominate online discussions. When someone asks for travel advice, they often get a list of the same top 10 tourist traps. I wanted to build a space that actively encourages unique perspectives, rewarding originality over popularity. The goal was to create a platform where human experience, not algorithms, dictates the best answer.

### My Solution: Anti-Algorithm

I handled everything from the user interface design to the full-stack development. I used Next.js to build a clean and responsive front end, and chose Convex for its powerful all-in-one backend, database, and real-time capabilities, which was perfect for a fast-paced hackathon.

The core of Idea Mesh is its unique use of AI. Instead of using an LLM to answer questions, I used it to generate a generic, cliché "social media-y" response first. This sets a baseline of what _not_ to say, challenging users to be more creative and share answers that are genuinely different.
