This project is my implementation of John Conway's famous "Game of Life" a zero-player game that demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from a few simple rules. It was built using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.

### My Approach: Turning a Simulation into a Canvas

While many versions of the Game of Life start with random noise or preset patterns, I wanted to create a more hands-on and artistic experience. My version gives the user a canvas and a simple "brush." You can click and drag your mouse to paint the initial state of the simulation, bringing clusters of cells to life with a stroke.
