## Hi, this is Leo Wong _aka ImPrankster_

I'm an Amateur Developer / Game Designer from Shanghai. This Blog is mainly for documenting my life and showcasing some of the projects I've been working on.

Interested in Tech, Gaming, Graphic Design, Front End & Game Development.

The articles will mainly be related to these topics, or just some random thoughts I had.

You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/ImPrankster).

Have a nice day!
